    "abstract: |\n",
    "  Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early detection and risk assessment critical for prevention. This project utilizes a classification model to predict heart disease risk based on a CDC dataset incorporating biological, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors. A logistic regression model with polynomial terms and L2 regularization was developed to capture non-linear relationships while addressing data imbalance. The key predictors identified include Age, General Health, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, and Sex, with General Health and Difficulty Walking significantly improving model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The model was evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC-AUC score, ensuring a balanced assessment of its predictive power. While recall and ROC-AUC improved, precision declined, indicating an increase in false positives. The final model explains 21.91% of the variance in heart disease occurrence, suggesting additional factors contribute to risk. Limitations include dataset imbalance and potential multicollinearity. Future improvements include using advanced balancing techniques and exploring more flexible models. These findings provide valuable insights for public health strategies, emphasizing the importance of early screening and targeted interventions for high-risk groups.\n",

    "I chose this dataset because heart disease is a leading cause of death, and understanding its risk factors can help with prevention. This topic is also personally significant to me, as some of my family members have experienced heart disease. The dataset includes biological, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors of heart disease, allowing for a holistic analysis of their impact. Exploring these relationships can provide valuable insights for public health and disease prevention."

Awareness campaigns targeting men, who appear to have a higher likelihood of heart disease, could also help with preventing heart diseases. \n",

Potential multicollinearity among polynomial terms could also affect model reliability.\n",

Additionally, incorporating more flexible and complex models could further enhance predictive accuracy and capture non-linear relationships more effectively. Finally, validating the model with external datasets will help assess its generalizability and ensure its findings can also be applied to broader populations. Addressing these limitations will lead to more accurate predictions and better-informed public health strategies to reduce heart disease risk."

While the model explains 21.91% of the variation in heart disease occurrence, its predictive power can be improved by addressing data imbalance, incorporating additional health factors, and refining feature selection. Strengthening these aspects will enhance public health interventions and support more targeted prevention strategies."
